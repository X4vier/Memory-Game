# In-browser memory game

I build this simple memory game to gain and demonstrate basic proficiency with HTML/Javascript. A link to the game may be found  [here](http://x4vier.github.io/).

Notable features include:

  - Responsive design - elements resize themselves to fit inside the window
  - Randomly generated card layout for each game
  - Customizable grid size
  - CSS animations (for card flips and background color changes)

The icons used in this maching game are taken from *Font Awesome*  - [Website here](https://origin.fontawesome.com/)
The background image was made by *Tori Pantha*, downloaded from *Subtle Patterns* [Website here](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/geometry-2/)
